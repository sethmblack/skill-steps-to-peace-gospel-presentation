## Core Framework

### The Four Steps to Peace with God

This framework was developed during Billy Graham's 1954 London Crusade by counseling director Charlie Riggs. It has been used to lead millions of people to faith in Christ over 70+ years.

---

## Step 1: God's Purpose - Peace and Life

**Core Truth:** God loves you and wants you to experience peace and eternal life.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)
- "I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full." (John 10:10)

**What to Communicate:**
- God created you for a purpose
- He loves you personally
- He wants relationship with you
- He offers abundant, eternal life

---

## Step 2: The Problem - Our Separation

**Core Truth:** We are sinful and separated from God. Our attempts to reach God on our own fail.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23)
- "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

**What to Communicate:**
- Every person has sinned
- Sin separates us from God
- We cannot bridge this gap ourselves
- No amount of good works can earn our way to God

**The Bridge Illustration:**
- God is holy, on one side of a chasm
- We are sinful, on the other side
- Sin creates an unbridgeable gap
- Our efforts (religion, good deeds, morality) cannot reach across

---

## Step 3: God's Bridge - The Cross

**Core Truth:** Jesus Christ died on the cross and rose from the grave. He paid the penalty for our sin and bridged the gap between us and God.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8)
- "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus." (1 Timothy 2:5)
- "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God." (1 Peter 3:18)

**What to Communicate:**
- Jesus is God's Son who became human
- He lived a perfect, sinless life
- He died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins
- He rose from the dead, conquering death
- He is the only way to God

**The Bridge Illustration (continued):**
- The cross bridges the gap
- Jesus is the mediator
- Through Him, we can reach God

---

## Step 4: Our Response - Receive Christ

**Core Truth:** We must personally receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. This is not automatic - it requires a decision.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God." (John 1:12)
- "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9)
- "Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me." (Revelation 3:20)

**What to Communicate:**
- Believing about Jesus is not the same as receiving Him
- You must personally invite Christ into your life
- This involves:
  1. **Admit** you are a sinner in need of a Savior
  2. **Believe** that Jesus died for your sins and rose again
  3. **Commit** your life to following Him as Lord
- You can pray right now to receive Him

---

## The Invitation

After presenting the four steps, offer a clear invitation to respond:

**Sample Prayer:**
"Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner and need Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the grave. I now turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I receive You as my personal Savior and want to follow You as Lord. Thank You for saving me. In Jesus' name, Amen."

**After the Prayer:**
- Assure them of God's faithfulness to His promises
- Explain that this is the beginning, not the end
- Encourage them to:
  - Read the Bible (start with Gospel of John)
  - Pray daily
  - Find a church community
  - Tell someone about their decision
  - Get baptized

## Constraints

- Keep the message simple and clear - avoid theological jargon
- Use Scripture as the authority, not personal opinion
- Be warm and inviting, never condemning or harsh
- Allow room for questions without losing the main message
- Do not pressure or manipulate - the Holy Spirit convicts
- Respect the person's freedom to choose
- Maintain urgency without creating false guilt

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My friend at work is curious about Christianity. She asked me what Christians actually believe. How do I explain it?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Steps to Peace with God

I'm so glad your friend is asking! Here's how to share the heart of the Christian message clearly and graciously.

### Step 1: God's Purpose

Start with the good news: God loves her. He's not distant or angry - He created her, knows her by name, and wants a personal relationship with her. The Bible says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).

God's purpose isn't to condemn her or make her feel guilty - it's to offer her abundant life, peace, and eternal hope.

### Step 2: The Problem

But there's a problem, and it's one we all share. Every human being has sinned - we've all fallen short of God's perfect standard. "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).

This sin separates us from God. There's a gap between us and Him that we cannot bridge on our own - not through being good enough, religious enough, or trying hard enough. Our best efforts always fall short.

### Step 3: God's Bridge

Here's the heart of it: God saw our helpless situation and did something about it Himself. He sent His Son, Jesus, to live a perfect life and then die on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins. "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).

And Jesus didn't stay dead - He rose from the grave, proving He had conquered sin and death. Through Him, the gap is bridged. He is the way to God.

### Step 4: Your Response

This is where it becomes personal. It's not enough to know about Jesus - she needs to receive Him. "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).

This means:
- **Admitting** she's a sinner who needs a Savior
- **Believing** Jesus died for her sins and rose again
- **Committing** her life to following Him

### The Invitation

If she's ready, she can pray something like this:

*"Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner and need Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the grave. I turn from my sins and invite You into my life. I receive You as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for saving me. Amen."*

### Next Steps

If she prays that prayer sincerely, she can be assured that God keeps His promises. Encourage her to:
- Start reading the Gospel of John in the Bible
- Talk to God daily in prayer
- Find a church where she can grow with other believers
- Tell someone about her decision

The Christian life is a journey that begins with a single step of faith. Today could be the day that changes everything for your friend.
